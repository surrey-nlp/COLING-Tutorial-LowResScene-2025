1d4dgk9,"The last Gov report showed the cost to the UK of reoffending was around 18 billion a year. 

The same statistics put the cost of housing a prisoner each year somewhere around 50k.

In the UK currently we have 95k people in prison.

Let’s say we invest 10 of that lost 18 billion into increased prison capacity. That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.

People have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can’t. It’s not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.

The whole myth around increased punishment isn’t a deterrent argument falls apart as well when scrutinised. How many of you would walk down the streets in the UK and smoke a joint? - Not worried about it right.. - Now how many of you would do the same in Singapore or Dubai? - Not so willing to are you, why? - Because you are shit scared of the consequences there, don’t nobody want to go to a Dubai Jail.

This country really needs to start investing in some fuck around and find out laws.",not sarcasm,not sarcasm

In this case, Dutton imposed his own deadline of revealing details of his Nuclear Power Plants, Housing, and Immigration for 16 May during his Budget Reply speech. Then he backflipped, and now Taylor is scrambling.",not sarcasm,sarcasm

1czcbpf,"Dutton has said the reactors would be on the site of (former) coal stations because the poles and wires are already in place.  So, shouldn't be too hard to work out and set-off the NIMBYs so they can help shoot down the stupid idea.  They can re-use the idiots who said wind turbines at sea would somehow kill whales - they'll be all over this.",sarcasm,sarcasm
1cvi72m,"They present *opinion* from those sources. But of course, opinion that aligns with one's ideology is *analysis*  

As you said, you shouldn't give credit to the news source for referring to *analysis* of others. 

Glad we agree those two measures quoted by The Spectator and The Guardian are inflationary (or at least I think we agreed, you haven't moved past the whole media watch thing yet).",not sarcasm,not sarcasm
